# PREDICTION OF COVID 19 USING CHEST X-RAY IMAGES

The tests currently being used to detect COVID 19 are very
accurate and can detect the presence of the novel corona
virus with precise accuracy . However, it is important to take
note that these tests are very time consuming and complex.
Our motivation behind making this model was that not all
places have sufficient medical facilities available and with the
increasing number of COVID 19 cases, healthcare facilities are
diminishing and are inaccessible to people in the rural areas.
A great doctor might outperform an AI algorithm but an AI
algorithm performs more consistently and better than an
average doctor. Hence, we wanted to come up with a testing
methodology that is both inexpensive and easily accessible
